# Dataset

The data set we used to evaluate the LLM-generated captions is in the directory `data/`.
This contains the following subdirectories:

-   `img/` the Statista graphs themselves
-   `csv/` the data used to make the graphs
-   `summary/` the human-written summaries of the graphs sourced from Statista
