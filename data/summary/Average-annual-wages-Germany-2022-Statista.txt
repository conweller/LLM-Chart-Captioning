Comparisons with rest of the EU

In neighboring Poland, the average annual salary was just over 32 thousand U.S dollars, meaning that Germanâ€™s earned, on average, almost twice of what their Polish counterparts did.  
German economy slowing in 2019
While Germany initially had one of the strongest recoveries from the 2008 financial crash and as of 2020 had the largest economy in Europe its economy has started to slow in recent years. For 2023 the German economy is forecasted to contract by 0.11 percent, while 2024 will mark a slight improvement with growth of 1.1 percent. Although the economic outlook is set to improve slightly, it remains to be seen if the low levels of growth predicted in the coming years will have an impact on German wages.
