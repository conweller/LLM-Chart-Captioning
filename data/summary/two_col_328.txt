The average annual price of Brent crude oil stood at 83 U.S. dollars per barrel in 2024. This is according to preliminary data from March. This is nearly 20 U.S. dollars lower than the 2022 annual average, when an energy supply shortage and concerns over fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war saw prices surge. Brent is the world's leading price benchmark for Atlantic basin crude oils. Crude oil is one of the most closely observed commodity prices as it influences costs across all stages of the production process and consequently alters the price of consumer goods as well.
